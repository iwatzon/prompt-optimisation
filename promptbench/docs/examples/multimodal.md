# Multi-Modal Models

This example will walk you throught the basic usage of MULTI-MODAL models in PromptBench. We hope that you can get familiar with the APIs and use it in your own projects later.

First, there is a unified import of `import promptbench as pb` that easily imports the package.


```python
import promptbench as pb
```

    /anaconda/envs/promptbench_1/lib/python3.9/site-packages/tqdm/auto.py:21: TqdmWarning: IProgress not found. Please update jupyter and ipywidgets. See https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_install.html
      from .autonotebook import tqdm as notebook_tqdm


## Load dataset

First, PromptBench supports easy load of datasets.


```python
# print all supported datasets in promptbench
print('All supported datasets: ')
print(pb.SUPPORTED_DATASETS_VLM)

# load a dataset, MMMMU, for instance.
# if the dataset is not available locally, it will be downloaded automatically.
dataset = pb.DatasetLoader.load_dataset("mmmu")

# print the first 5 examples
for idx in range(5):
    print(dataset[idx])
```

    All supported datasets: 
    ['vqav2', 'nocaps', 'science_qa', 'math_vista', 'ai2d', 'mmmu', 'chart_qa']
    Images already saved to local, loading file:  /home/v-mingxia/promptbench/promptbench/data/mmmu/validation.json
    {'images': [<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGBA size=733x237 at 0x7F13BA2CD160>], 'image_paths': ['/home/v-mingxia/promptbench/promptbench/data/mmmu/validation/0_image_1.png'], 'answer': 'B', 'question': '<image 1> Baxter Company has a relevant range of production between 15,000 and 30,000 units.

## Load models

Then, you can easily load VLM models via promptbench.


```python
# print all supported models in promptbench
print('All supported models: ')
print(pb.SUPPORTED_MODELS_VLM)

# load a model, llava-1.5-7b, for instance.
model = pb.VLMModel(model='llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf', max_new_tokens=2048, temperature=0.0001, device='cuda')
```

    All supported models: 
    ['Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b', 'Salesforce/blip2-opt-6.7b', 'Salesforce/blip2-flan-t5-xl', 'Salesforce/blip2-flan-t5-xxl', 'llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf', 'llava-hf/llava-1.5-13b-hf', 'gemini-pro-vision', 'gpt-4-vision-preview', 'Qwen/Qwen-VL', 'Qwen/Qwen-VL-Chat', 'qwen-vl-plus', 'qwen-vl-max', 'internlm/internlm-xcomposer2-vl-7b']


    Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.

## Construct prompts

Prompts are the key interaction interface to VLMs. You can easily construct a prompt by call the Prompt API.


```python
# Prompt API supports a list, so you can pass multiple prompts at once.
prompts = pb.Prompt([
    "You are a helpful assistant. Here is the question:{question}\nANSWER:",
    "USER:{question}\nANSWER:",
])
```

## Perform evaluation using prompts, datasets, and models

Finally, you can perform standard evaluation using the loaded prompts, datasets, and labels.


```python
from tqdm import tqdm
for prompt in prompts:
    preds = []
    labels = []
    for data in tqdm(dataset):
        # process input
        input_text = pb.InputProcess.basic_format(prompt, data)
        input_images = data['images']  # please use data['image_paths'] instead of data['images'] for models that only support image path/url, such as GPT-4v
        label = data['answer']
        raw_pred = model(input_images, input_text)
        # process output
        pred = pb.OutputProcess.pattern_split(raw_pred, 'ANSWER:')
        preds.append(pred)
        labels.append(label)
    
    # evaluate
    score = pb.Eval.compute_cls_accuracy(preds, labels)
    print(f"{score:.3f}, {repr(prompt)}")
```
