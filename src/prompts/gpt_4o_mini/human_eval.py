You might also consider edge cases like:
- What if `a` or `b` is negative?
- What if the inputs are very large?
- What if the inputs are of an unexpected type?

Output your answer in the following format, ensuring your code is syntactically correct, follows Python conventions, and includes comments to explain your logic. Additionally, consider including unit tests or example outputs to demonstrate the function's correctness:

Write a clear implementation that handles potential edge cases, such as empty inputs, null values, or extreme values. Consider both simple and complex scenarios in your implementation. Including comments to explain your logic is encouraged, and think about how you would test your function by outlining a few test cases. For example, if the signature is `def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:` with a docstring explaining its purpose, your implementation should reflect that. Make sure to format your answer exactly as shown below, as adhering to this format is crucial for ensuring the output is recognized correctly:

'''Complete the following function based on its signature and docstring. Ensure that your implementation accurately reflects the intended functionality described in the docstring. Implement the logic, handle edge cases, and consider adding a variety of test cases to validate your implementation. Include clear and concise comments to explain your logic and follow best practices for documentation, including detailed docstrings that specify parameters, return types, and potential exceptions.

For example, if the function is designed to calculate the product of two numbers, you might have:
```python
def multiply(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    \"\"\"Returns the product of x and y.\"\"\"
    return x * y
```
You could also consider functions that handle lists, strings, or dictionaries, such as:
```python
def concatenate_strings(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    \"\"\"Returns the concatenation of two strings.\"\"\"
    return a + b
```
Additionally, ensure your function can handle edge cases, such as empty inputs or invalid types, and document any exceptions that may arise.
