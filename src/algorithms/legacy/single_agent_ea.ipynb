      "1. **\"How can I simplify the problem followed by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts to compute the factorial of a number?\"**\n",
      "   - **Reasoning:** This prompt is highly effective as it focuses on simplifying the problem and suggests a clear, structured approach by breaking it down into smaller parts. This method is especially useful in tackling complex problems like computing factorials, which inherently involve iterative or recursive steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **\"Can we devise an experiment and modify the current algorithm for computing the factorial of a number?\"**\n",
      "   - **Reasoning:** This prompt encourages experimental thinking and iterative improvement. It indicates a willingness to modify and test the current algorithm, which is essential for optimization and can lead to more efficient solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **\"What are the key assumptions and alternative perspectives on the problem of computing the factorial of a number?\"**\n",
      "   - **Reasoning:** This prompt is effective because it encourages critical thinking about the assumptions underlying the problem. Considering alternative perspectives can help in understanding potential limitations or discovering new approaches, though it is slightly more abstract compared to others.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **\"What are the potential risks and drawbacks of different methods, and how can we measure progress on computing the factorial of a number?\"**\n",
      "   - **Reasoning:** This prompt prioritizes understanding the risks and drawbacks of different methods, which is important for evaluating different algorithms. However, it is somewhat less focused on the initial problem-solving approach and more on an evaluative phase, making it slightly less effective as a starting point.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **\"What are the underlying causes and what is the best way to modify a current algorithm for computing the factorial of a number?\"**\n",
      "   - **Reasoning:** This prompt can be ambiguous as it mentions \"underlying causes\" without clearly defining what causes are being referred to—this could cause confusion. Additionally, it merges two different objectives (diagnosing causes and modifying an algorithm), which can dilute focus and effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the most effective prompts are those that focus on breaking down and simplifying the problem or suggest iterative experimentation and refinement. Less effective prompts tend to be those that mix multiple objectives or focus on evaluative criteria before a solution is fully developed.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m### Ranked Prompts after Initial Iteration\n",
