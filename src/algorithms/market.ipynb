      "{content}\n",
      "\n",
      "**Output Requirements:**\n",
      "1. **Identify Aspects:**\n",
      "    - Read the text and identify different aspects mentioned (e.g., customer service, product quality).\n",
      "2. **Identify Sentiments for Each Aspect:**\n",
      "    - For each identified aspect, determine if the sentiment is positive or negative.\n",
      "    - List each aspect and its sentiment in the following format:\n",
      "        - Aspect: {aspect_name}, Sentiment: {positive/negative}\n",
      "    - Ensure to identify and classify all relevant aspects.\n",
      "3. **Determine Overall Sentiment:**\n",
      "    - Count the number of positive and negative sentiments.\n",
      "    - Identify if any sentiment is stronger based on either more frequent mentions or stronger wording.\n",
      "    - Determine the overall sentiment based on the stronger or more frequent sentiment.\n",
      "4. **Provide Final Output:**\n",
      "    - Provide the overall sentiment of the text at the end as either ##positive or ##negative (no spaces).\n",

      "- Overall Sentiment: ##negative\n",
      "\n",
      "### Success Criteria:\n",
      "- The prompt MUST instruct the model to classify the text's overall sentiment as either positive or negative.\n",
      "- The prompt MUST include the content placeholder {content}.\n",
      "- The prompt MUST instruct the model to output the final answer as ##positive or ##negative without spaces.\n",

      "1. **Reinforce Key Instructions:**\n",
      "   - Key steps, such as identifying aspects and counting sentiments, are explicitly outlined.\n",
      "   - Clear instructions for determining overall sentiment based on strength or frequency are provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Enhance Clarity with Examples:**\n",
      "   - The example output illustrates the process of aspect identification, sentiment analysis, and overall sentiment classification.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Consistency in Terminology:**\n",
      "   - Consistent use of terms like \"aspect\" and \"sentiment\" throughout the instructions. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Guidelines Check:\n",
      "- **Did Not Modify Existing Restrictions:**\n",
      "  - All original restrictions remain unaltered.\n",
      "- **Did Not Modify or Remove Negations:**\n",
      "  - No modifications to negations have been made.\n",
      "- **Did Not Add, Modify, or Remove Placeholders:**\n",
      "  - Placeholders denoted by curly braces remain intact and unaltered.\n",
      "- **Treated Placeholders as Actual Content:**\n",
      "  - Instructions and example output treat {content} as actual customer feedback content.\n",

      "2. **Include content placeholder**: The `{content}` placeholder is present in the prompt.\n",
      "3. **Instruct output as ##positive or ##negative with no spaces**: The prompt specifies the output format as \"##positive\" or \"##negative\" with no spaces.\n",

      "1. **Modifications**: The prompt includes explicit instructions to break down the text and evaluate each aspect's sentiment without changing existing restrictions.\n",
