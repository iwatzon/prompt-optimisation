      "1. **Understand the Function Signature:**\n",
      "   - Review the function signature to identify the expected inputs and outputs, including their types.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Analyze the Docstring:**\n",
      "   - Carefully read the docstring to understand the function's purpose, behavior, and any specific requirements or constraints.\n",
      "   - Pay attention to the description of the parameters and the return value.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Implement the Function:**\n",
      "   - Write the complete function code that adheres to the given signature and fulfills the described functionality in the docstring.\n",
      "   - Ensure the function is efficient, handles edge cases, and includes necessary error handling.\n",
      "   - **Tip:** Include comments in your code to explain any complex logic or decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**\n",
      "- **Function Signature:** `def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:`\n",
      "- **Docstring:** `\"\"\"\n",
      "    Adds two integers and returns the result.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Args:\n",
      "        a (int): The first integer.\n",
      "        b (int): The second integer.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Returns:\n",
      "        int: The sum of the two integers.\n",
      "    \"\"\"`\n",
      "\n",
      "**Implementation:**\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n",
      "    return a + b\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Now, implement the function:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Function Signature:** `{function_details}`\n",
      "- **Docstring:** `{docstring}`\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Requests:**\n",
      "- If there are any specific edge cases or examples you'd like to be tested, please provide them. For example, if the function should handle empty inputs, negative numbers, or very large values, mention these cases.\n",
      "- If the function involves complex logic or external dependencies, include any additional information or constraints. For instance, if the function needs to interact with an external API or handle asynchronous operations, provide relevant details.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Testing:**\n",
      "- After implementing the function, write tests to verify its correctness. Ensure that the tests cover both typical use cases and edge cases.\n",
      "- **Tip:** Use a testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest` to organize and run your tests efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
