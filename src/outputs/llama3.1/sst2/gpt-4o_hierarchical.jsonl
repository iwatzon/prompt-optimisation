This creates a sense of tension and discomfort, which is not positive.\n\nEmotive language: The phrase \"chokes on its own depiction\" uses a metaphor to create a vivid image of something being overwhelmed, which is emotive and engaging. However, the overall tone is negative because it implies that this struggle is a weakness rather than a strength.\n\nLexical choices: The word \"decorum\" has a slightly old-fashioned or formal connotation, which may contribute to the sense of stuffiness or oppression implied by the text.\n\nContext: Without more information about the subject being discussed, it's difficult to say for certain what the context is. However, based on the language used, it seems likely that the text is discussing a novel or story that's trying to convey a sense of upper-class propriety but is struggling to do so effectively.\n\nInterrelations between aspects: The phrase \"chokes on its own depiction\" implies that the subject is struggling to convey its intended message, which creates tension and discomfort.
