However, the phrase \"the odds against success are long enough to intimidate\" introduces a negative sentiment, implying that there may be significant challenges ahead.\n4. But then it says \"but short enough to make a dream seem possible\", which is a positive statement, suggesting that despite the difficulties, there's still hope for success.\n\nConsidering these points, I would classify the overall sentiment of the text as **positive**, because the final message of hope and possibility outweighs the initial mention of intimidating odds. \n\n## Positive",
