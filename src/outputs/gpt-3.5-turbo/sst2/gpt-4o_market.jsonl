            "prompt": "Classify the sentiment of the following text as either positive or negative, considering the nuances and context of the sentiment expressed. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify and list the aspects mentioned in the text.\n2. Evaluate the sentiment of each aspect, considering the context and nuances of the language used. For example, words like \"okay\" or \"fine\" might be neutral but can lean positive or negative based on context. Pay special attention to the intensity of sentiment words (e.g., \"terrible\" is stronger than \"bad\").\n3. Grade the sentiment of each aspect as positive, negative, or neutral. If an aspect is neutral, consider whether it leans positive or negative based on context.\n4. Determine how these aspects contribute to the overall sentiment by weighing the number and intensity of positive and negative sentiments. Note that strong negative sentiments might outweigh multiple mild positive sentiments. Use a scale to balance sentiments, for example:\n   - Strong Positive: +2\n   - Mild Positive: +1\n   - Neutral: 0\n   - Mild Negative: -1\n   - Strong Negative: -2\n5. Consider the overall balance of sentiments before making the final decision. If the total score is positive, classify the sentiment as positive; if negative, classify it as negative.\n6. Output your answer at the end as ##positive or ##negative with no spaces.\n\nExample:\nText: \"The food was delicious, but the service was terrible.\"\nAspects: \n- Food: Positive (delicious) +2\n- Service: Negative (terrible) -2\nOverall Sentiment: ##negative (due to the strong negative sentiment of the service)\n\n{content}\n\nPlease assess the level of positivity or negativity before making a decision.\nOutput your answer at the end as ##positive or ##negative with no spaces.",
