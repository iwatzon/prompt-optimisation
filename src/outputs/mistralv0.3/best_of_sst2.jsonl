For example, it could provide a step-by-step approach to ensure thorough analysis.\\n\\n   - **Clear Step-by-Step Instructions:**\\n     The instructions could be more detailed to ensure clarity. For instance, the prompt could specify how to handle multiple aspects and how to weigh their sentiments to arrive at an overall sentiment.\\n\\n   - **Appropriate Instructions for Task Complexity:**\\n     Given the complexity of sentiment analysis, especially with nuanced texts, the instructions should be comprehensive enough to handle various scenarios, such as mixed sentiments within a single text.\\n\\n**Suggested Improvements:**\\n\\n1. **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\\n   - **Step 1:** Identify and list all the aspects mentioned in the text.\\n   - **Step 2:** Evaluate the sentiment of each aspect individually, considering the context in which it is mentioned.\\n   - **Step 3:** Assign a sentiment score (1 to 5) to each aspect based on its evaluation.\\n   - **Step 4:** Determine the overall sentiment by weighing the individual aspect sentiments.\\n   - **Step 5:** Output the final sentiment as ##positive or ##negative and provide the overall sentiment score.\\n\\n2. **Detailed Instructions:**\\n   - **Aspect Identification:** Look for distinct elements or topics within the text that are being discussed.\\n   - **Context Consideration:** Pay attention to the surrounding words and phrases that provide context to each aspect.\\n   - **Sentiment Scoring:** Use a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is very negative, 3 is neutral, and 5 is very positive.\\n   - **Overall Sentiment Calculation:** Consider the number of positive and negative aspects and their respective scores to determine the final sentiment.\\n\\n**Revised Prompt:**\\n\\nClassify the sentiment of the following text as either positive or negative, considering any nuances and the degree of sentiment.
