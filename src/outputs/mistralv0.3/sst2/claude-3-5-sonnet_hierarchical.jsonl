The use of words like \"dreamlike,\" \"cheesy,\" and \"voluptuous\" in a positive context suggests enjoyment or appreciation of the described experience. However, without more context about the reader's personal preferences or expectations, it's difficult to definitively classify the sentiment as either positive or negative.\n\nFinal answer: ##positive (with some reservations due to the use of \"cheesy\" and \"voluptuous cheap effects\")",
