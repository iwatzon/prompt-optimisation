It provides clear guidelines on how to write the function, including using meaningful variable names, writing comments, handling exceptions, organizing code logically, avoiding code duplication, and optimizing for performance. The prompt also includes examples of simple functions and functions with error handling to guide the LLM.\\n\\n#### Step 2: Explain How the Prompt Can Be Improved\\n\\n1. **Break-down Complex Tasks:**\\n   - The prompt could be more effective if it breaks down the task into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, it could first ask the LLM to identify the purpose of the function based on the docstring, then to outline the steps needed to achieve that purpose, and finally to write the code.\\n\\n2. **Clear Step-by-Step Instructions:**\\n   - The instructions could be more explicit by providing a step-by-step approach. For instance, it could specify that the LLM should first handle any potential exceptions, then write the main logic, and finally add comments and optimize the code.\\n\\n3. **Appropriate Instructions for Task Complexity:**\\n   - The prompt should ensure that the instructions are appropriate for the complexity of the task. For more complex functions, it might be helpful to provide additional examples or more detailed guidance.\\n\\n#### Step 3: Submit Feedback\\n\\n### Feedback\\n\\nThe prompt is clear and concise, but it can be improved by breaking down the task into smaller steps and providing more explicit, step-by-step instructions.

This aligns well with the principle of providing context to help the model understand the task.\\n\\n2. **Clarity and Specificity:**\\n   - The instruction to \\\"output your final answer at the end as ##<your answer (arabic numerals)>\\\" is clear and specific, ensuring the model knows exactly how to format the answer. This is crucial for maintaining consistency and clarity in the output.\\n\\n3. **Role Design:**\\n   - The revised prompt implicitly assigns the model the role of a meticulous problem solver by asking for a \\\"detailed solution.\\\" This helps in setting the right expectations for the model's performance.\\n\\n### Suggestions for Further Improvement:\\n\\n1. **Explicit Steps:**\\n   - To further enhance the clarity and ensure the model follows a structured approach, you could explicitly ask the model to break down the problem into steps. For example:\\n     ```\\n     Solve the following maths word problem carefully and provide a detailed solution with step-by-step explanations: \\n     {content}\\n     Please output your final answer at the end as ##<your answer (arabic numerals)>\\n     ```\\n\\n2. **Contextual Relevance:**\\n   - Adding a brief context about the importance of solving the problem correctly could help the model understand the significance of accuracy. For example:\\n     ```\\n     Solve the following maths word problem carefully and provide a detailed solution with step-by-step explanations. This will help ensure the accuracy and clarity of your solution: \\n     {content}\\n     Please output your final answer at the end as ##<your answer (arabic numerals)>\\n     ```\\n\\n### Final Feedback:\\n\\nThe revised prompt is already quite effective in providing clear instructions and ensuring the model understands the task. However, adding explicit steps and a brief context about the importance of accuracy can further enhance the prompt's effectiveness.

This would ensure that the LLM takes into account the subtleties and complexities of human emotions, which are often conveyed through context and nuanced language.\\n   - Additionally, providing a brief explanation of what constitutes positive and negative sentiment in terms of emotional impact, emotive language, and lexical choices could help the LLM make more accurate classifications.\\n   - Including a note about the importance of considering the overall tone and mood of the text, rather than focusing solely on individual words or phrases, could also enhance the LLM's ability to accurately classify sentiment.\\n\\n3. **Submit your feedback.**\\n\\n### Revised Prompt:\\n\\n\\\"Classify the sentiment of the following text as either positive or negative.

Understand its content and intent.**\\n\\nThe prompt instructs the model to classify the sentiment of a given text as either positive or negative by listing aspects, assigning sentiment scores, averaging them, and then determining the overall sentiment. The final output should be either ##positive or ##negative along with the overall sentiment score.\\n\\n2. **Explain how you think the prompt can be improved in light of your core principles.**\\n\\nThe prompt is quite structured and methodical, which is good for consistency. However, it could be improved by explicitly instructing the model to consider the emotional impact, emotive language, and lexical choices in the text. This would ensure that the analysis is more nuanced and aligned with the core principles of an Emotive_Sentiment_Analyst.\\n\\n**Suggested Improvements:**\\n\\n- **Emotional Impact:** The prompt should explicitly ask the model to consider how the text might make a reader feel.\\n- **Emotive Language:** The prompt should instruct the model to identify and weigh emotive words or phrases.\\n- **Lexical Choices:** The prompt should guide the model to consider the connotations of specific words used in the text.\\n\\n**Revised Prompt:**\\n\\nClassify the sentiment of the following text as either positive or negative.
