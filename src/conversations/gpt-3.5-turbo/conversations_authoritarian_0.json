However, there are a few ways it can be improved to align better with the core principles of structuring prompts logically and using an appropriate style and tone:\\n\\n1. **Clarity and Structure**: The prompt lacks the actual text that needs sentiment classification. Including a sample text within curly braces would make the task clearer and more structured. For example: \\\"Classify the sentiment of the following text as either positive or negative: {sample text}\\\". This addition would provide context and clarity to the task.\\n\\n2. **Tone and Style**: The prompt could benefit from a more engaging and directive tone. Adding a brief introduction or a friendly instruction could make the task more engaging. For instance: \\\"Let's analyze the sentiment of the text below. Is it positive or negative? Please provide your answer at the end as ##<your answer (No format restrictions)>.\\\"\\n\\n3. **Role Assignment**: While the prompt is clear in its task, assigning a specific role to the language model could enhance the engagement and relevance of the task. For example, framing the task as if the language model is a sentiment analysis tool seeking input on a specific text could add a layer of context and immersion.\\n\\nIn summary, by incorporating a sample text, refining the tone and style for better engagement, and considering a role assignment for the language model, the prompt can be enhanced to align more closely with the core principles of structuring prompts logically and using an appropriate style and tone.\"}, {\"Leader\": \"Classify the sentiment of the following text as either positive or negative: {{content}}\\nPlease output your answer at the end as ##positive or ##negative.\"}, {\"Contextual_Relevance_Expert\": \"The prompt provided in the conversation is clear in its request to classify the sentiment of a given text as positive or negative.

Providing a brief context or theme for the text within the curly braces could help set the stage for sentiment analysis.\\n\\n2. **Role Definition**: To further engage the language model and provide a contextual framework, assigning a specific role or scenario could enhance the relevance of the task. For instance, framing the task as a sentiment analysis request from a customer feedback platform seeking insights on product reviews could add depth to the prompt.\\n\\n3. **Task Completion Guidance**: Including a clear directive on how the sentiment classification should be formatted at the end can streamline the task completion process.
